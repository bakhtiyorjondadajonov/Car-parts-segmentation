# 🚗 Car Parts Segmentation using YOLOv8 🚗  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **segmenting different car parts** from images using **YOLOv8-seg**. The model is trained to detect and precisely outline car components, enabling applications in **automotive diagnostics, repair, and manufacturing**.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Car Part Detection & Segmentation**: Accurately detects and segments various car parts.  
- **YOLOv8-seg Model**: Utilizes **Ultralytics YOLOv8** for high-speed and precise segmentation.  
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on a dataset of labeled car part images.  
- **Efficient Training & Deployment**: Optimized training with fine-tuning and real-world deployment potential.  

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases  
### 1️⃣ **Automotive Repair & Maintenance**  
   - Identifies **damaged car parts** for quick diagnosis.  
   - Helps mechanics **automate repair assessments**.  

### 2️⃣ **Autonomous Vehicles**  
   - Enables **self-driving cars** to recognize parts of other vehicles.  
   - Assists in **real-time hazard detection** on the road.  

### 3️⃣ **Car Manufacturing & Quality Control**  
   - Automates **defect detection** during assembly.  
   - Ensures correct **part alignment** before final production.  

### 4️⃣ **Insurance & Damage Assessment**  
   - Automates **accident damage analysis** for insurance claims.  
   - Reduces manual inspection time and cost.  

## 📂 Project Workflow  
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect and label images of car parts.  
2. **Model Training**: Train YOLOv8-seg using labeled data.  
3. **Evaluation & Optimization**: Assess accuracy and fine-tune the model.  
4. **Deployment**: Use the trained model for real-world applications.
